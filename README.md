# My First CPU Emulator in C

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-inactive-red)

Welcome to my first C program! This is a virtual machine for the [BatPU-2](https://github.com/mattbatwings/BatPU-2) that I created as part of my learning process. It simulates RAM and the CPU architecture as well as the display and input peripherals.

## üì¶ Project Status

**‚ùå Inactive** ‚Äì This project is no longer in active development.  
I may revisit it in the future, but for now it's considered paused/completed and is here mainly for reference or learning purposes.

## About the Project

This project is still in its very early development phase. It is a Virtual Machine written in C that simulates the mattbatwings' "BatPU-2" CPU and many other things like RAM.

## Acknowledgements

I want to take a special moment to thank **[Mattbatwings](https://www.youtube.com/@mattbatwings)** for his incredible work. His series of videos building a **CPU in Minecraft** has been an invaluable source of knowledge for me. Thanks to his tutorials, I've been able to better understand complex concepts related to processor architecture and low-level programming.

I highly recommend checking out his YouTube channel, as he offers educational and entertaining content that has helped me a lot in my learning journey.

Thank you, Mattbatwings!

## How to use:
1. Clone this repository
```bash

2. Write an assembly program named "program.as" in root directory.


3. Clone the assembler found in BatPU-2 repo into  the project's root directory


4. Run make



Current Status

This is my first C program.

The project is still in the early development stage, and many features are missing.

Inconsistencies are expected since I am a novice in low-level programming and this is my first time working with C.
